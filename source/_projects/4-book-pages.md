title: Book Pages
description: This application is being built for my son to safely access books we have created for educational and entertainment purposes.
    It has a page builder to add images and text, and different permission levels help determine which actions can be utilized on the app,
    which protects the child from accessing any links out of the site.It uses Laravel, Vue3, tailwind.css and Amazon S3 for storage.
