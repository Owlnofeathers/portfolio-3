title: Special Education Helper
description: 
    Creates a useful resource for parents struggling to make sense of the IEP process, and what laws to reference in their 
    state if things go wrong. It has a scheduler that scrapes legislation from states websites, and normalizes the 
    data into a single format for easy searching. It uses Laravel Jetstream's team support for collaboration on important documents.
    VueJs 3 and InertiaJs. At this time the site is not live. but you may fork it on GitHub!
